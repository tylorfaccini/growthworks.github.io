        <p>
          As a Sales Specialist in appliances I serve as the store expert in the appliance department by providing detailed product information to both 
          customers and peers. I am resposible for promoting and recommending products, protection plans, and installation services 
          that match the customers needs, generating leads, conducting sales activities, building relationships with customers, 
          keeping shelves stocked and products correctly displayed. I am also responsible for coordinating successful completion of projects

        <p>
        As the assistant branch manager it was my job to ensure the branch was compliant
        with all of the necessary audits, from ensuring that cash and negotiable instruments are
        correctly processed with the federal reserve, to ensuring that documents are retained
        for the correct amount of time. I would also set up
        meetings with potential and current clients to build and maintain long term relationships
        with personal clients and business customers in the surrounding area.
        </p>
        <p>
        I created and implemented an outside sales planner and guide that was used
        in our yearly round table meeting and distributed to all Michigan branches to help further push
        business relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this roll I also took it upon myself to immerse myself in the leadership roll
        and develop new training guides for my staff. Each employee was given a binder where
        training material was kept. I would hold monthly meetings with each employee to ensure
        they felt like they were on the right track in their career development and take time
        ensure I understood what their goals were and the best way to help them obtain them.

          At WestAmerica Bank I was responsible from all things operational, from account

          I was in charge of organizing the banks float in the annual summer parade for the town of Healdsburg.
          This meant going beyond my daily work tasks to complete unique tasks that were assigned to me.
          Using resources in and around the community, our float placed third in the parade. This job
          more than others taught me the importance of organization. Being organized made sticking to the time line possible
          which completed the task.

          and learning operations. I was promoted to teller III and then to branch supervisor. As a branch Supervisor
          my main responsibility was to assist the tellers and ensure the teller line is running as smoothly as possible
          We could open and close accounts if the branch manager and assistant branch manager were unavailable.
